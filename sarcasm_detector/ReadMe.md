This project is a model that detects sarcasm with an 80-82% accuracy. I attempted to increase the accuracy by increasing layers and changing the learning rate. I discovered through research that having 80% accuracy was optimal accuracy due to how abstract sarcasm is, escpicially through text.

Inspiration for code taken from this kernel on kaggle, changed code to work locally in conda enviroment.
